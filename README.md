### 1. ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project structure is designed to be easy to understand and navigate. Here's a quick overview of the directories and files you'll find in this project:

```bash
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/             # Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/         # Site configuration
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ config.json # Top-level site configuration, like title, description, metas, some astro settings, etc.
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ menu.json   # Configure the site visible navigation in header and footer
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ social.json # Social links and icons
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ theme.json  # Your theme names and font settings (used in tailwind.config.js, related to styles/theme.css)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/        # Markdown and mdx files for dynamic content following the Astro conventions (see below)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Reusable components

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/          # Site pages (follows Astro conventions)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/         # Global and component-specific styles
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs    # Astro configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js  # TailwindCSS configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # No need to explain
â””â”€â”€ [editor cfg files]  # Project dependencies and scripts
```

### 2. ðŸ§© Built-in Components

The starter comes with a set of components that you can use to build your site basic structure.
Ideally, you should use them as a starting point and modify them to fit your needs.

There's only a few of them that are considered **core and generic**:

```bash
/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Logo.astro      # The site logo. Reused across the site, every page has it.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Section.astro   # A section with a title, content and an optional image. Is a standard content block that every page has.
â””â”€â”€ â””â”€â”€ PageHeader.astro # Used to display the page title and description, intended to bind with the page `mdx` data.

```

Every other component is considered **specific** and is used in the demo site. You can use them as inspiration or modify them to fit your needs.

### 3. ðŸŽ¨ Theme Customization

The starter comes with a default theme that you can customize to fit your needs.
There's 3 files involved in the theme customization:

```bash
/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ theme.css    # The main theme file, where you can define your colors.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ theme.json    # A JSON file used for theme domain names and font settings. Define your theme color names and font settings here.
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js   # The tailwind configuration file, you know what it is, the other two files are used here.
```
 


## ðŸ§ž Commands (by Astro)

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
